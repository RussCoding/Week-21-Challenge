The purpose of this assignment was to become more skillful with different APIS and interfaces.  In this 
project we took a working express project and modified it to work with GraphQL API and Apollo Servers. 
This was useful because it taught us how to take working projects and improve them with
better technologies.  Being able to be flexible and modify code is an important skill for a coder.
